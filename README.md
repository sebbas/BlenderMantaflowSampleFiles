# Blender Mantaflow Sample Files

This is just a collection of some Blender scenes that work well in Blender Vanilla and in the Blender Mantaflow version.

## Usage
For each fluid type you will find the according ``.blend`` files. So when playing around, just make sure to load the correct file for your Blender version.

## Why distinguish between Vanilla and Mantaflow version?

Several reasons:

- The Mantaflow version has some additional options that have to be set (e.g. for wavelet noise)
- Some values (e.g. vorticity) need to be set differently for Mantaflow to make sense
